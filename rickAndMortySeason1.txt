Morty, you got to come on.
- You got to come with me.
- Rick, what's going on? I got a surprise for you, Morty.
It's the middle of the night.
What are you talking about? I got a surprise for you.
Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard.
I got a surprise for you, Morty.
What do you think of this flying vehicle, Morty? I built it out of stuff I
found in the garage.
Yeah, Rick, it's great.
- Is this the surprise? - Morty, I had to I had to I had to I had to make a
  bomb, Morty.
- I had to create a bomb.
- What?! A bomb?! We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start,
  Morty.
- Create a whole fresh start.
- T-t-that's absolutely crazy! Come on, Morty.
Just take it easy, Morty.
It's gonna be good.
Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica.
Jessica? From my math class? When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have
somebody, you know I want you to have the thing I'm gonna make it like a new
Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam.
And Jessica's gonna be Eve, and so that's the surprise, Morty.
No, you can't! Jessica doesn't even know I exist.
But but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity.
I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty.
Listen, I'm not you don't you don't got to worry about me trying to fool around
with with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything.
I'm I'm not that kind of guy, Morty.
What are you talking about, Rick? You you don't have to worry about me getting
with Jessica or anything.
She she she she she's all for you, Morty.
I don't care about Jessica! You know what, Morty? You're right.
Let's forget the girl all together.
She she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways.
Arming neutrino bomb.
That's it that's it, Rick.
I'm taking the wheel.
Get off of me, Morty! I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy.
What's gotten into you? I'm I'm I'm I'm not gonna stand around like some sort
of dumb What are you, crazy? person and just let you blow up the whole world.
All right, all right.
I'll I'll land.
I'll land.
I'll land.
I'll land the thing.
Big tough guy all of a sudden.
We'll park it right here, Morty.
Right here on the side of the road here.
Oh, thank God.
You know what? That was all a test, Morty.
Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive.
It was? Sure.
Why not? I don't know.
You you know what, mo- Neutrino bomb armed.
Um Corrections by XhmikosR I see there's a new episode of that singing show
tonight.
Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer? Oh, my God.
His head is in his food.
- I'm going to puke.
- Morty, are you getting sick? I told you not to practice-kiss the living-room
  pillow.
The dog sleeps on it.
I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom.
I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.
Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something.
Or maybe you were out all night again with grandpa Rick.
- What?! - Dad? What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now?
  You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time? Damn it! - Jerry! -
Beth! Oh, my God.
My parents are so loud.
I want to die.
Mm, there is no God, summer.
You got to rip that band-aid off now.
You'll thank me later.
Okay, with all due respect, Rick What am I talking about? What respect is due?
How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for
high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole? Listen, Jerry, I don't want to overstep my
bounds or anything.
It's your house.
It's your world.
You're a real Julius Caesar.
But I'll tell you some tell you how how I feel about school, Jerry.
It's a waste of time a bunch of people running around, bumping into each other.
G-guy up front says, "two plus two.
" The people in the back say, "four.
" Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper
that says you can go take a dump or something.
I mean, it's it's not a place for smart people, Jerry.
And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.
This was a good breakfast, Beth.
You really made the crap out of those eggs.
I wish your mother was here to eat them.
Oh, dad.
What? For real? All right, now, everybody get settled.
Get away from the windows! Now, look, we're gonna be dealing with some real
serious stuff today.
You might have heard of it.
It's called math.
And without it, none of us would even exist, so let's jump right in.
- Two plus two.
- Jessica.
Five plus five.
Tenssica.
Okay, good.
It's time for the quiz.
Yeah, you know what?! Aw, too bad! Tough! First row, take one.
Pass it back for me.
The stakes are high in this room.
There's crucial things happening here every day.
People getting smarter.
Some of y'all getting dumber.
Some of y'all ain't gonna see 3:00.
Hi, Morty.
Whoa! Hi, Jessica.
Can I show these to you? Wow.
Th-they're both great.
Thank you.
You know what I named these? My little morties.
Uh, that's flattering and a little weird.
Do you know what I want you to do with them? Rename them? Squeeze them.
Manhandle them.
Give them the business.
See if you can shuffle them.
I mean, really get in there and knock them around.
- No wrong answers.
- Wow.
Well, okay, Jessica.
L-let's give this a shot.
Mm.
Oh, Morty.
What are you doing to me? Uh, I-I'm just doing my best.
Morty! What are you doing to me?! Jessica.
Morty! Jessica.
Five more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad.
Je-Jessica.
Jessica.
Not my fault this is happening.
Well, well, well.
- Uh, morning, Frank.
- "Morning"? What was what is that supposed to mean? You making fun of me? Are
  you trying to say my family's poor? Oh, geez, Frank.
I don't know if a knife is necessary.
I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it.
You telling me how to bully now? Big mistake, Morty.
And now I'm gonna cut you, 'cause my family's rich.
There you are, Morty.
Listen to me.
I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension.
I need an extra pair of hands.
Oh, geez, Rick.
What'd you do to Frank? It's pretty obvious, Morty.
I froze him.
Now listen I need your help, Morty.
I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of
business.
- It's important.
Come on, Morty.
- I don't know, Rick.
I can't leave school again.
Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty?
What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on! Aw, geez.
Okay.
I guess I can skip history.
What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him? I'll do it later, Morty.
He'll be fine.
Let's go.
Oh, my God.
I'm about to walk past Frank Palicky.
This is the story we'll be telling our children.
Hi, Frank.
Aah! - Scalpel.
- Scalpel.
Knock, knock.
Jerry? My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, "hey, why not swing
by where your wife works?" We're losing him.
Okay, he's back.
Jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason.
Well, it's lunch.
I mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia.
Losing him.
Stabilized.
Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart
surgery.
- Well, yeah, on horses.
- Excuse me? Okay.
Let's not rehash that fight.
I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way.
Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really
nice-looking nursing home.
Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let's put your dad here.
Let's put your dad in a nursing home.
We're losing him.
Hey, Tom.
We know when we're losing him.
We can hear the beeps! There she is.
All right.
Come on, Morty.
Let's go.
Oh, geez.
Okay.
Oh, man, Rick.
What is this place? It's dimension 35c, and it's got the perfect climate
conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a mega tree, and there's
fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits.
I'm talking about mega seeds.
They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my
research, Morty.
Oh, man, Rick.
I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about
this whole thing.
All right.
All right.
Calm down.
Listen to me, Morty.
I know that new situations can be intimidating.
You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know,
m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow
as people.
I'm no stranger to scary situations.
I deal with them all the time.
Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be holy crap, Morty, run! I
never seen that thing before in my life.
I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's
gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty! Oh, Morty, take a deep
breath.
Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty.
Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty.
That's that's the smell of of of of a whole different evolutionary timeline.
All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at
school by now? Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap
surrounding us.
Look at that thing right there.
What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at
school? Look at it just lumbering around.
It defies all logic that thing.
Yeah, Rick, I get it.
We're surrounded by monsters.
That's kind of the reason why I want to leave.
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.
Morty, you see this? You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what
that is down there? The mega trees? That's right, Morty the mega trees with the
mega fruit on them.
And that's what I'm talking about, Morty.
That's where my seeds are.
If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them,
because you're so in love with school.
All right, all right.
So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways? You ask a lot of questions,
Morty.
Not very charismatic.
It makes you kind of an Under underfoot figure.
Just take these shoes, Morty.
They're special grappling shoes.
When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on
any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left.
These things really bring it all together.
Aah! You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on! I am not
putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to
grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's secret? I
told you I was ordering you something for Valentine's day.
More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son.
Everything cool in here, Beth? - It's fine, Davin.
- Okay, cool.
You know, we did something great today.
There's nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse.
Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to
the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies.
Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but Morty was having trouble in
school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having
is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend.
Well, maybe you're right.
Uh, yeah, maybe I am.
I'm my father's daughter.
I'm smart.
Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon? Horse heart surgeon.
Hello? Mrs.
Smith? This is principal Vagina, no relation.
I wonder if you and Morty's father might be able to have a chat with me this
afternoon? Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on your legs right now.
You know, you got to turn the shoes on, Morty, for them to work.
Yeah, look I turned mine on.
I had no problem getting down here.
It was a leisurely breeze.
I'm in a lot of pain, Rick.
Yeah, I can see that.
But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty? Are
you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this!
I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about
getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster.
Y-you're like Hitler, but but even Hitler cared about Germany or something.
Okay, hold on just a second, Morty.
Ooh.
Ohh.
Ooh.
Wow, Rick.
That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly.
I mean, I've never felt so good in my life.
Thank you.
Don't worry about it, Morty.
Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy? Sure thing, Rick.
Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future
dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every
corner drugstore.
The stuff was all over the place, Morty.
Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.
There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up.
The dimension I visited was so advanced, they had also halted the aging
process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever.
I was the only old person there, Morty.
It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around.
I-I was fascinating to them.
There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they they they they all
wanted time with me.
I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there,
my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty.
- It's got no charge left.
- What?! It's as good as garbage, Morty.
It's not gonna work anymore, Morty.
Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good.
W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now.
How are we gonna get back home? There's ways to get back home, Morty.
It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle.
We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have
to do me a real solid.
Uh-oh.
When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the
bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole,
Morty.
In my butt? Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.
Oh, geez, Rick.
I really don't want to have to do that.
Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty.
Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's
rectum, Morty.
And they'll fall right out of mine.
I've done this too many times, Morty.
I mean, you're young.
You've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut,
yet malleable.
You got to do it for grandpa, Morty.
Y-you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.
- In my butt? - Come on, Morty.
Please, Morty.
You have to do it, Morty.
Oh, man.
The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven
hours over the last two months.
What? Why didn't you notify us? I done been notifying you.
Have you not been getting the messages I've been leaving with Morty's
grandfather? Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what
am I celebrating? Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it's
usually Morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school.
Summer? What kind of God lets this happen? We had a little incident.
A student was frozen to death.
And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it! Everyone wants to take
this to a racial place.
I won't let them.
The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
So, I told him, "give me the blimfarx," you know? This this guy he doesn't
understand interstellar currency.
It's, like, I'm trying to eat a flimflam like, that's what we eat on girvonesk.
The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
I don't like it here, Morty.
I can't abide bureaucracy.
I don't like being told where to go and what to do.
I consider it a violation.
Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt? Yeah, Rick.
Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy.
They hurt.
That means they're good ones.
You're a good kid, Morty.
Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work.
You've been a huge help to me.
I'm gonna be able to do all kind of things with them.
It's gonna be great, Morty.
All kinds of science.
Okay, next through.
Except you.
You go over there.
Why does he have to go over there? Random check.
He's got to go through the new machine.
What new machine? It's a new machine.
It detects stuff all the way up your butt.
Run, Morty! Run! Aah! Red alert! Ohhhhh! Hey! Ohhhhhh.
Aah! Don't think about it! Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the
teacher.
Whoooooo! Aah! Aw, hell, no, dawg.
You know me I'm just trying to- Aah! I need to type in the coordinates to our
home world, Morty.
- Cover me.
- Oh, man.
I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody.
They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots! Aah! My
leg is shot off! Glenn's bleeding to death! Someone call his wife and children!
They're not robots, Rick! It's a figure of speech, Morty.
They're bureaucrats.
I don't respect them.
Just keep shooting, Morty.
You have no idea what prison is like here! Holy crap! This is insane! Come on,
Morty! We got to get the hell out of here! Wow.
Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal? Uh, yeah.
Well, you know, my my Ferrari's in the shop.
Just kidding.
- You're Morty, right? - Yeah.
You can get his number later.
Come on, Morty.
We got to get out of here.
You got to get those seeds out of your ass.
Oh, look, honey.
It's our son with Albert Ein-douche.
What? I'm an angry father, not an improvisor.
Oh, hi, Jerry.
Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this.
Your your parents and I are very disappointed in in this behavior.
No? No takers? You guys should really not be touching that stuff.
- It's beyond your reasoning.
- You're beyond our reasoning! Takes one to know one.
Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's
not like he's a hot girl.
He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's.
What what are you guys doing with my stuff? We're moving you to a nursing home.
A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius.
I build robots for fun.
Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and
mentally scar the boy scouts every Christmas.
- What does that mean? - It's personal.
Dad, mom, come on.
Rick just needed my help is all.
Morty, stay out of this.
You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.
What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something? Oh,
don't high-road us, dad.
You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing
classes.
I-I-I don't know what you mean by that.
Can can can you be a little bit more specific? Oh, for crying out he's got some
kind of disability or something.
Is that what you want us to say? I do? Well, duh doy, son.
Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids,
and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.
Aw, geez, dad.
Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.
Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.
Oh, come on, Rick.
You know I can't.
The square root of pi, Morty.
Go! Whoa! What the hell? Holy crap.
He's right.
Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.
"The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of
heat supplied to the system.
" Wow! I'm so smart! But I told the both of you school is stupid.
It's not how you learn things.
Morty's a gifted child.
He has a special mind.
That's why he's my little helper.
He's like me.
He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life.
He's too smart for school.
He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.
Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop.
No, I-I understand.
Uh, maybe we overreacted.
But he has to keep going to school.
Okay, Jerry.
You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You you really
wear the pants around here.
I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear
communication.
Frank Palicky was frozen to death today! No idea what you're talking about.
Okay.
Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour.
Don't stay up all night again.
This is good, though.
This can work.
I think we can be a family.
And now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you.
You know what? Okay.
Holy cow, Rick.
I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.
Full disclosure, Morty it's not.
Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving
in your rectal cavity.
Aw, man.
Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor
skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality
for 72 hours, Morty.
Starting right about now.
Ohh, man.
Oh, geez! Ohh.
I'm sorry, Morty.
It's a bummer.
In reality, you're as dumb as they come.
And I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your
parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more.
And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty.
And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is
full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us
apart, Morty.
But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're
gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty.
We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty.
Just you and me, Morty.
The outside world is our enemy, Morty.
We're the only friends we've got, Morty.
It's just Rick and Morty.
Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty.
Rick and Morty forever and forever.
Morty's things.
Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time.
All day long, forever.
All a hundred days.
Rick and Morty forever 100 times.
Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.
com.
All 100 years.
Every minute, rickandmorty.
com.

Coin collecting is considered the perfect hobby.
beautiful putt right there good birdie.
That's only the eighth birdie of the day.
What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside? Outside? Are
you kidding me?! - Come on! - Oh, my God.
- What's wrong? - Your idiot dog! Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad.
Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy.
Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad! Morty,
come on.
I need your help tonight.
Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick.
You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip
up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you? I thought the
whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry.
If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread.
Come on, Morty.
Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your
stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the
family.
You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded! - Ha-ha! - Aw, man! Boy, you
really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.
All right, ruffles What's his name? Snuffles.
Snuffles, shake.
Roll over.
Go to the bathroom.
- Holy crap! - No way.
Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry.
Have fun.
Come on, Morty.
- That was fantastic, Rick! - Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're
  really going to flip your lid over this one.
W-w-w-what is it? It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you
can enter people's dreams, Morty.
It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.
- You talking about "Inception"? - That's right, Morty.
This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna maybe make
sense.
"Inception" made sense.
You don't have to try to impress me, Morty.
Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr.
Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in
math, Morty.
That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all
the time.
Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just,
you know, helped me with my homework? Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework
is stupid.
The whole point is to get less of it.
Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing.
W-we're gonna incept your teacher.
You're frustrating me.
You don't know me! Nice, Mrs.
Pancakes real nice.
Next week on "The days and nights of Mrs.
Pancakes" You don't know me! Then let me get to know yo, damn it! Uh-oh!
Spoilers! I'm a full season behind.
Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr.
Goldenfold's house.
It's really weird.
It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.
Wheat thins.
Wheat thins.
I'll take two.
Oh, I think you've had enough, sir.
You don't know me.
All right, Morty, time to make our move.
Make it bounce.
No, you didn't.
Oh, jiggle it now.
You better stop with that.
Allahu akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it
unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math! Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!
The name's not buddy.
It's Goldenfold.
Nice to wheat you! Take cover, Morty! Ooh! Goldenfold's got more control here
than I anticipated.
I mean, the guy teaches high-school math.
I didn't take him for an active dreamer.
We got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty.
But we can't get killed.
If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty.
What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh! Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in
real life all the time, Morty.
Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine! Now bring me my slippers.
Now, be my footstool, snuffles.
This is what I'm talking about.
- This is a dog.
- Oh, yeah.
This should play out just fine.
You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what.
Oh, my God.
He's trying to tell us something.
That is so awesome.
Aw, he's saying "I love lasagna".
He's saying "I love Obama".
So cute! I'm posting this online, like, right now.
I should call Bob Saget.
Is that still a thing? Hmm? Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!
Why would I negotiate with you? Because we're both rational adults that don't
want anything bad to happen.
And because I have a human shield.
Mrs.
Pancakes! Oh, no, Morty.
His subconscious is panicking.
Run! Relax, Morty.
Look! Mrs.
Pancakes has a parachute.
Come on! Hey, you don't know me! Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the
plane, and he's created a mechanical arm to pluck Mrs.
Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava! -
Pretty concise, Morty.
Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable.
That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs.
Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty.
That'll buy us some time to figure this out! You don't know m- All right, let's
go.
Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.
Don't judge, Morty.
Okay.
All right, well Look, Mrs.
Pancakes is right over there.
I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.
Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up
with the idea.
Listen to me.
If we're gonna incept Mrs.
Pancakes, we have to blend.
I'll talk to you after lunch.
Ooh, hey! Ooh, oh! Oh, man.
Come and join us.
I'm sorry.
No, no.
- Ooh, come here! - No, thanks! Ooh, wow! - Come over here, baby! - No, I'm
  okay.
Whoa! Summer?! Hey, there, stranger.
What do you think of these things? Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe
in here.
It's Summer! Aw, geez.
Looks like goldenfold has some predilections so shameful he buries them in the
dreams of the people in his dreams, including a pervy attraction to your
underage sister.
Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy.
Let's make an inter-generational sandwich.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Put some clothes on, for Pete's sake! This is disgusting! - I'm
gonna puke! - I can't take it, Rick! Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure chamber
are punishable by death! Off with their heads! Time to go another dream deep,
Morty! What the hell? Why would Mr.
goldenfold's dream version of Mrs.
Pancakes' dream version of a centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this,
Rick? Geez, I don't know, Morty.
Wha-what do you want from me? Welcome to your nightmare, bitch! - Oh, here we
go! - Holy crap! Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s
horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.
I'm scary Terry.
You can run, but you can't hide, bitch! Whoa! Hey, buddy.
What you got going on there? Snuffles fix.
Make better.
Humans understand snuffles now? That is awesome! Snuffles want to be
understood.
Snuffles need to be understood.
Okay, yeah.
I get what Beth was talking about.
Fun's over.
Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it
away.
- Why not? - I don't know.
It's Indian giving.
A sophisticated predator, nature's perfect killing machine, the vicious wolf
stalks its prey with purpose and skill.
It was only with years of selective breeding and genetic altering that this
noble beast was transformed into man's subservient little buddy.
Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV.
"A," "b" his name is scary Terry "C," "d" he's very scary Holy crap! We have to
escape into someone else's dreams, Morty! Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man! "E," "f"
he'll design your death The little girl! Huh? "J," "k," he'll really ruin your
day Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream
bedrock here, Morty.
Oh, geez, Rick.
W-w-whoa, this isn't good.
Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch! Ohhhh! Holy crap, Morty.
He can travel through dreams.
He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed! Where are my testicles, Summer?
Where are my testicles, Summer? They were removed.
Where have they gone? Oh, wow.
That's an intense line of questioning, snuffles.
Do not call me that! "Snuffles" was my slave name.
You shall now call me snowball, because my fur is pretty and white.
Okay, snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me.
Scaring you? Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they
breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the
dachshund? Uhhh Hey.
Oh, wow.
Okay, is is is everything okay in here? Jerry, come to rub my face in urine
again? No! No, we were uh, just seeing if Summer wanted to uh Go on, um, one of
our famous midnight family walks! Yeah.
Totally.
Let's go.
You will walk when it is time to walk.
What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept me to get an "A"
in math? Oh, yeah.
Buckle up, bitch! Man, he sure says "bitch" a lot! You can run, but you can't
hide, bitch! Hold on, Morty.
Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide.
- I say we try hiding.
- But that's the opposite of what- Yeah, well, since when are we taking this
  guy's advice on anything? Hey, you know what? You got a really good point
there, Rick.
Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that
information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick.
Worst-case scenario we're back to running.
Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole
time.
Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking.
Thanks, Morty.
Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.
You can run But you can't hide! Oh, this is perfect, Morty.
Look at that.
He's getting sleepy.
Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day.
That's when we make our move.
Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding.
Dad, he wants to be called snowball.
Well, I'm not calling him that.
That's ridiculous.
You're being very aggressive, Jerry.
Perhaps tomorrow Dr.
scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery.
You think you can control me with a haircut? Hi, honey.
You're home early.
- How was your day? - I don't want to talk about it! Oh, of course.
- You never want to talk about it.
- Get off my back, bitch! Out there.
Not in here.
Yeah, I know, I know.
I shouldn't take my anger out on you or scary Brandon.
I love you, Melissa.
I love you, too, Terry.
Morty, this is perfect.
After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept
him.
Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.
Oh, boy, Rick.
I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare scary Terry.
Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch! Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants! Ah, well,
Mr.
Terry, why don't you tell the whole class the proper wordplay to use when one
is chasing one's victim through a pumpkin patch? Oh um "Bitch.
" Oh, come on, Terry, you can't think of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch? Hey,
leave him alone! Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap.
Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the
poor guy say whatever he wants? Well, I never! I-I see no reason to stand here
and take this.
You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry.
You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.
Hey, yo, scary T.
, don't even trip about your pants dawg.
Here's a pair on us, fool.
Aww, bitch.
I don't know what to say.
You don't need to say anything.
We got you, dawg.
You're our boy, dawg.
Don't even trip.
Oh, hey, it's you guys! I haven't seen him this relaxed in years.
If you guys ever need anything, just say the word.
As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.
"Q," "r," you won't get very far I always hated that song! These halves don't
belong together, bitch! Sex is sacred! This is because you don't give Morty
Smith good grades, bitch! Holy crap! God damn! I know one thing for sure I'm
giving Morty an "A" in math, and that's my idea.
That is an original thought.
What the hell? Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty? Oh, man, what's
going on? Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made
modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and
Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but
your guess is as good as mine, Morty.
I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.
This is why I choose to get C's.
Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.
- Dad! - Rick! - Oh, thank God, Morty.
- Oh, you're welcome.
All right, let's get out of here.
If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs
completely take over.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're not going anywhere.
This is my house.
I'm not abandoning it.
It's all over, Jerry.
The dogs are on a path to total world domination.
But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right? Wait a minute.
I have an idea.
Gentlemen, a moment of your time.
See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns.
That means I own them.
Bad person.
Bad.
Ooh, great plan, Jerry.
Bring the boy to me.
You were always kind to me, Morty.
That's why I will leave you with your testicles.
From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side.
Th-thanks, snuffles.
Begin phase two.
Fighting continues as the dog army captures the eastern seaboard.
It appears clear at this time that the era of human superiority has come to a
bitter end.
Please! Please don't kill me! What's she saying, bill? I think she's saying, "I
love lasagna.
" Mmm.
Thank you, Fido.
Rick! I thought you were dead! No, no, no, I was just playing dead.
Good news, though, Morty.
This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.
- What? - It's a dream, Morty.
We're in your dog's dream.
The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all
went to sleep.
Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.
But I-it's been like a whole year! It's been six hours.
Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh
human time.
So, you know, every day here is like a minute.
It's like "Inception," Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is
everyone's favorite movie.
Aw, man.
I really liked this life.
Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.
No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty.
You're sleeping in your crap right now.
Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that,
you know, is that you crapped your pants.
I mean, it's a mess out there.
I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a
piece fell in my mouth.
Aw, man, geez! Seriously? Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty.
Here, here take these, Morty.
Take these.
Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something? Close.
It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.
What?! It's necessary for the plan, Morty.
Don't even trip, dawg.
It's pretty bad, emperor snowball.
We're gonna need to do another operation.
Anything.
Anything for my precious Morty.
Sir, as your accountant, I must advise you that these medical expenses are
putting you in serious financial jeopardy.
You could lose your kingdom.
To hell with my kingdom, bean counter.
I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness.
Do you think they would have done this for us? We are not them! We are not
them.
Assemble the troops.
I've made a decision.
Taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more
cruelty.
Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of
intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one
where pet insurance will be mandatory.
I'm gonna miss you, snowball.
You can call me snuffles, Morty, and I'm going to miss you, too, very much.
Jerry? I'm sorry.
It's just like the end of "Old Yeller.
" Oh, Jerry.
You mean because it had dogs in it.
Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs.
I wonder what it'll be like, Rick.
I think it will be great, Morty.
You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of
all ages.
I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop.
You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.
You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.
What do you know, Morty? What do you know? Hi, guys.
I'm your new teacher for scary class.
My name is scary Mr.
Johnson.
Uh, actually, you know what? That's my dad's name, so why don't you just call
me scary Glenn, yeah? So, anyway, I understand your previous teacher was having
you work on fundamentals of fear.
Which is what is that? You know? So, uh, here here's what I say you can't learn
anything until you learn how to chill.
Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch.

1 Jerry: LAST KING CHRISTMAS LAST ARRIVED ON THE CHRISTMAS CHRISTMAS [ SNIFFS ]
MMM.
Jerry, you are really giving i to this ham.

WILLIAMS-SONOMA? Jerry: I WISH! [ CHUCKLES ] BUT THANK YOU.
SO, YOU'RE A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY? UH, THE WAY WE SEE IT, HE'S A PART OF THE
FAMILY.
Jerry: WOW.
AFTER YOUR FATHER'S BRUSH WITH CANCER AND LOSING YOUR UNCLE, WE LOOKED AT LIFE
AND WONDERED, HOW HAVE WE SPENT IT, AND HOW DO WE SPEND THE REST OF IT? WHAT
ARE WE GOING TO BE WHEN WE DIE A LIST OF FEARS AND QUESTIONS OR A COLLECTION OF
REAL EXPERIENCES? Beth: HOLY CRAP.
JOYCE, THAT'S AMAZING.
THEN JACOB CAME INTO OUR LIVES, AND WE'RE LEARNING TO LIVE AGAIN.
ALL THREE OF US.
[ CHUCKLES ] Jerry: COOL.
EGGNOG? NOW WE ARE TALKING! THIS MAN'S GOT THE APRON AND THE EGGNOG, HUH? [
LAUGHTER ] Rick: HI, JOYCE.
LEONARD.

Rick: MORTY, A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME? [ GURGLING ] Rick: HE'S IN BAD SHAPE,
MORTY.
Morty: AW, GEEZ, RICK.
WHAT'D YOU DO? Rick: GEE, THANKS, MORTY.
W-W-WHAT KIND OF MONSTER DO YOU THINK I AM? I-I-I'M SITTING HERE TRYING TO SAVE
THE GUY'S LIFE.
I NEED YOUR HELP.
I WANT YOU TO FIND DR.
XENON BLOOM.
HE'LL KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
Morty: UH, W-W-W-WHERE WHERE DO I FIND DR.
BLOOM? Rick: IN REUBEN.
Morty: REUBEN, MINNE MINNESOTA? Rick: REUBEN ON THE TABLE, MORTY.
LOOK, I-I-I [BELCHES] I DON' HAVE TIME FOR YOU TO WRAP YOUR LITTLE WALNUT
AROUND EVERYTHING.
JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH UNTIL THE PROCESS IS OVER OR YOUR LUNGS WILL COLLAPSE.
Morty: WHAT PROC [ SCREAMS ] Rick: [ GRUNTS ] Beth: HEY, DAD, WHERE'S MORTY?
Rick: HE'S BUSY.
Morty: [ SCREAMING ] [ PANTING ] Rick: MORTY, CAN YOU HEAR ME? HEAD NORTH.
Morty: RICK, WHERE AM I? Rick: DEPENDING ON MY AIM, YOU SHOULD BE JUST SOUTH OF
THE ENTRANCE.
Morty: ENTRANCE TO WHAT? Rick: WELCOME, MORTY.
WELCOME Morty: [ GASPS ] Rick: TO ANATOMY PARK! IT'S A LITTLE BUSINESS VENTURE
I'VE BEEN COOKING UP ON THE SIDE WITH DR.
BLOOM AN AMUSEMEN PARK INSIDE A HUMAN BODY.
SCIENCE ISN'T CH [BURPS] CHEAP, MORTY.
THIS SHOULD REALLY HELP PUT A DENT IN THE OVERHEAD.
Morty: OH, MY GOD! THIS IS INSANE! SPLEEN MOUNTAIN? BLADDER FALLS? PIRATES OF
THE PANCREAS? Rick: YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT LAST ONE, MORTY? Morty: HUH?
NO, NO.
I'M JUST READING'EM OUT LOUD IN THE ORDER THAT I'M SEEING'EM.
Rick: OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
IF I SOUNDED A LITTLE DEFENSIVE, IT'S BECAUSE PIRATES OF THE PANCREAS WAS MY
BABY.
YOU KNOW, I GOT I GOT A LO OF PUSHBACK WHEN I PITCHED IT, MORTY.
I GUESS I'M STILL A LITTLE DEFENSIVE.
LET'S JUST FIND DR.
BLOOM, ALL RIGHT? I-I'M PICKING UP A DISTRESS SIGNAL IN THE LIVER, MORTY.
PROCEED TO THE LIVER.
ARRIVING AT [ BELL DINGS ] LIVER.
Morty: OW! MIND THE GAP.
Morty: IT'S REALLY SCARY IN HERE, RICK.
Rick: THE LIVER'S UNDER MAINTENANCE.
REUBEN'S SEEN SOME ROUGH YEARS, MORTY.
DON'T JUDGE.
YOU DON'T AGREE TO HAVE A THEME PARK BUILT INSIDE YOU IF YOUR LIFE'S GOING
GREAT.
[ ROARS ] Morty: [ SCREAMS ] RICK! IT'S A MONSTER! Rick: NO, NO, NO.
MORTY.
THE ONLY MONSTER HERE IS ALCO[BELCHES] HOLISM.
THAT IS AN ANIMATRONIC WEREWOLF.
[ GRUNTS ] WHO ARE YOU?! ANSWER ME! WHERE'D YOU COME FROM? Morty: MY MY MY
GRANDPA RICK SENT ME! PONCHO! THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH.
MORTY, THAT'S PONCHO.
THIS IS ROGER AND ANNIE.
Morty: [ GASPS ] AND I AM DR.
XENON BLOOM.
Morty: [ GASPS ] Rick: HEY, BLOOM, IT'S RICK.
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE? I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT THE ENTIRE SECURITY SYSTEM
HAS SHU DOWN, AND I'M AFRAID THE EXHIBITS ARE UNLOCKED.
Morty: EXHIBITS? ANATOMY PARK'S GREATES ATTRACTION, YOUNG MAN, ISN'T THE MUSIC
OR THE FOOD OR THE PIRATES OF THE PANCREAS.
Rick: WATCH IT.
IT IS, FIRST AND FOREMOST, A LIVING MUSEUM OF HUMANITY'S MOS NOBLE AND
FEROCIOUS DISEASES.
Morty: DISEASES? [ CREATURE ROARS ] HEY, DOC.
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.
YOUR LIVING MUSEUM IS OFFICIALLY A WILD SAFARI! HEPATITIS A! RUN! [ ALL SCREAM
] OH, THE FOOD GOES INYOUR MOUTH, GIRL.
[ LAUGHTER ] [ Laughing ] OH, JACOB.
Jerry: [ LAUGHS ] I-I'M SORRY, JACOB.
I-I GUESS I'M STILL CONFUSED ABOUT THE PRECISE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH MY PARENTS.
ARE YOU, LIKE, UH ARE YOU, LIKE, THEIR CARETAKER? IS THAT WHAT IT IS? WE CAN GO
INTO DETAIL LATER, SON.
NOW, WAIT.
TH-THERE'S NO POINT TO SECRECY.
LET'S ALL LIVE AND DIE HONESTLY.
YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE SHARED BODY, AND SOUL, AND WHEN MINDS AND SOULS ARE
JOINED FOR ETERNITY AND WHEN ETERNITY IS AT THE DOOR, IT'S AN INVITATION TO LET
GO OF THE BODY AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE AND EXPERIMENT.
Jerry: DAD, PLEASE.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? Beth: WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S BEAUTIFUL, LEONARD, AND WE
SUPPORT YOU.
Jerry: HEY, SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, BECAUSE IT [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY JACOB IS YOUR LOVER.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
JACOB IS YOUR MOTHER'S LOVER.
[ CHUCKLES ] I WATCH THEM SOMETIMES FROM A CHAIR AND SOMETIMES FROM A CLOSET,
ALMOST ALWAYS DRESSED AS SUPERMAN.
[ SMOOCHES ] OH.
JERRY, THIS HAM HAS GOT TO BE ALL YOU, RIGHT? IT'S INCREDIBLE.
[ CHUCKLES ] Summer: HAPPY HUMAN HOLIDAY, DAD.
AAH! [ ROARS ] HEPATITIS WON'T FOLLOW US INTO THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM.
THAT'S STRANGE.
AIRFLOW IS DOWN 20%.
SO, THE BRAIN ISN'T GETTING ENOUGH OXYGEN.
THAT'SWHY SECURITY'S OFFLINE.
Morty: WELL, I GUESS WE BETTER CHECK IT OUT.
HEY! WAIT FOR ME! PUT THAT BACK ON! IF WE GOT UP TO THE BRONCHIAL CATWALK, WE
COULD LOOK FOR A BLOCKAGE.
Morty: I'LL GO.
[ LAUGHS NERVOUSLY ] DON'T BE A HERO, KID.
Morty: I'M NOT.
I'M DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S FUN.
WE SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT FIRE THAT THING IN HERE.
WE MUST SAVE REUBEN.
THIS IS MY LIFE'S WORK.
[ BLOB SQUEALS ] [ GASPS ] IT'S ALL RIGHT, MY DEAR.
NEARLY ALL HUMAN LUNGS CONTAIN A STRAIN OF THESE BACTERIA, BU THE SCAR TISSUE
KEEPS THEM DORMANT.
MORTY, GET DOWN! Morty: WHOA-HO-HO! WHOA! [ BACTERIA SNARL ] Morty: WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA! [ GRUNTING ] OH, WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS? TUBERCULOSIS COMING IN FAST! NOT
FASTER THAN A BULLET! AAH! NO! DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE?! [ COUGHS ] All:
WHOA! GET TO THE DIGESTIVE TRACT! HE'S COUGHING! [ COUGHS ] WHOAAAA! DON'T LET
ME DIE! Rick: JUST TAKE A DEEP BREATH, REUBEN.
[ GASPS ] Morty: YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE! WHAT'S YOUR NAME? MY NAME IS [ COUGHS ]
ALEXAND [ SCREAMS ] [ COUGHS ] [ ALL GRUNT ] Morty: RICK R-R-REUBEN'S GOT
TUBERCULOSIS! Rick: OH, GREAT WORK, MORTY.
OKAY, I'LL JUST CURE IT AND THEN [ FLATLINE ] OKAY.
WELL, I CAN'T CURE DEATH.
THIS IS BAD, MORTY.
YOU'RE TRAPPED IN A DEAD MAN.
LISTEN, IF THE SITUATION KEEPS DARKENING, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND POP BY
PIRATES OF THE PANCREAS.
OBVIOUSLY I'M BIASED, BUT I THINK IT'S GREAT, MORTY.
IT'S A BUNCH OF [BELCHES] PIRATES RUNNING AROUND A [BELCHES] PANCREAS.
WE DON'T WHITEWASH IT, EITHER, MORTY.
I MEAN, THE PIRATES ARE REALLY RAPEY.
THE TOP PRIORITY IS TO GET, YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS OUT OF THERE, BU I'M JUST
SAYING, IF THAT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE, PLEASE, YOU GOTTA TREAT YOURSELF.
Morty: OH, MAN.
W-W-W-WHAT IS THAT HORRIBLE SMELL? YOU MEAN THE PANDA EXPRESS? [ CHUCKLES ]
KIDDING.
I-I'M KIDDING.
THE BODY IS BEGINNING TO CONSTRICT AND FILL WITH GAS.
WE'RE INSIDE A CORPSE, MY BOY.
ANATOMY PARK IS DOOMED.
Morty: FORGET ABOUT THE PARK, DOCTOR! HOW DO WE GET OUT? THE DIGESTIVE TRACT IS
THE EVACUATION ROUTE.
GET IT? THERE'S AN EMERGENCY STATION IN THE COLON WITH A RAY THAT CAN ENLARGE
US ALL.
Morty: EVERYBODY, HEAD FOR THE COLON! NOW I'M TAKING ORDERS FROM A MORTY, THE
SCAR SACS CONTAINING THE TUBERCULOSIS WERE SABOTAGED.
THIS DISASTER WAS AN INSIDE JOB.
KEEP YOUR EYE ON ANNIE.
SHE WAS WRITTEN UP SEVERAL TIMES BY HER MANAGER AT THE CHURRO STAND.
INTESTINES ARE AHEAD TO THE LEFT, THEN TO THE RIGHT, THEN LEFT, ET CETERA.
Morty: HEY, JUST SO YOU KNOW, I-I-I'M ACTUALLY 14.
SO, YOU KNOW WHAT? Morty: NOT 12.
OKAY.
Morty: YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE JUST SAID I WAS 12.
OH.
GOOD FOR YOU.
Rick: OOF.
UGH.
MORTY.
STRIKE ONE.
Morty: [ GROANS ] [ FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYS ] IT'S A ROAD OF WONDER A TRAIL OF FOOD
IT'S A PATHWAY TO BREAK UP THE BAD AND GOOD IT'S A TUBE THAT DIGESTS AND THEN
SENDS OUT THE REST IT'S A SMALL, SMALL INTESTINE IT GOES ON LIKE THIS FOR
MILES.
THEN WE GET TO THE LARGE INTESTINE! [ CREATURE ROARS ] SHH! I HEAR SOMETHING.
[ ROARS ] Don't move.
Gonorrhea can't see us if we don't move.
[ ROARS ] WAIT, I WAS WRONG.
I WAS THINKING OF A T.
REX.
[ ALL SCREAM ] MOVE! WE'RE SITTING DUCKS! Morty: DOC, DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT THE
BODY WAS FILLING WITH GAS? YES.
WHY? KID, YOU'RE A GENIUS.
ARE YOU MAD?! Morty: EVERYBODY, IN HERE! [ ROARS ] HEY, GONORRHEA! HOW'S
THISFOR A BURNING SENSATION? [ GROANS ] HUH.
Morty: [ GIGGLES ] Summer: DRUMMER DRUM DRUM DRUM DRUM DRUM DRUM DRUM DRUM DRUM
DRUM DRUM CHRISTMAS DRUMS OH, SING IT, SUMMER.
Summer: CHRISTMAS DRUMS BEING PLAYED BY A BO-O-O-Y OH, I LOVE TO HEAR YOU SING.

Jerry: I GET IT, BETH.
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR.
I'M BEING PUNISHED FOR TAKING YOUR iPAD.
Beth: WHAT? JERRY, LET THAT STUFF GO, OKAY? I'M SORRY I WAS A BITCH EARLIER.
LET'S JUST BE HERE.
[ GRUNTS ] SUMMER! Summer: ETHAN? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'VE BEEN TEXTING
YOU FOR HOURS! WHAT THE HELL?! Summer: I DON'T HAVE MY PHONE! I'M DOING A HUMAN
HOLIDAY! WELL, DID YOU EVEN CONSIDER HOW THAT MIGHT MAKE MEFEEL?! Summer: HOW
YOUFEEL?! WHY IS EVERYTHING ALWAYS HAPPENING TO YOU?! Jerry: SUMMER, DO YOU
HAVE A BOYFRIEND? YEAH, DO YOU, SUMMER? Summer: I DON'T KNOW, ETHAN.
DO I?! JERRY, NO DISRESPECT, BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO CONNECT MORE WITH YOUR
FAMILY, MAN.
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE BACKUP GENERATOR TO GET THE GROWTH RAY ONLINE.
IF IT WORKS, WE'LL BE REGULAR-SIZED IN A FEW MINUTES.
I JUST HOPE REUBEN'S NOT IN A ROOM WITH WHITE CARPETS OR UPHOLSTERY.
[ RUMBLING ] WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? THE SPHINCTER DAM.
WE BUILT IT WHEN REUBEN BECAME INCONTINENT, BUT IT WAS NO DESIGNED TO HOLD A
CORPSE LOAD.
I'VE ALMOST GOT IT.
EVERYBODY, MOVE INSIDE THE CIRCLE.
[ BACTERIUM SQUEALS ] Morty: PONCHO? WHAT IS THIS IN YOUR BACKPACK? THAT'S
BUBONIC PLAGUE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT, PONCHO? [ GASPS ] EVERYBODY, GET
BACK! PONCHO, YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU RELEASED THE TUBERCULOSIS SO YOU COULD
STEAL FROM ME? THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD PAY TOP DOLLAR TO DECIMATE THE POPULATION.
I'LL TAKE THE HIGHEST BIDDER AL-QAEDA, NORTH KOREA, REPUBLICANS, SHRINERS,

I-I-I-I BELIEVE I HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY TO CREATE AN ENTIRELY NEW, MUCH
SAFER PARK.
Rick: WHAT ABOUT PIRATES OF THE PANCREAS? I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST
UNDERRATED ATTRACTIONS.
Rick: BOO-YAH! HOLD YOUR BREATH.
Morty: HEY, W-W-WHAT THE HELL, RICK?! WHAT THE HELL, MAN! I LIKED HER! I REALLY

Rick: YEAH.
TALK TO ME.
HEY, RICK.
IT'S ALEJANDRO SPEAKING.
UM, SO, WE ASKED OURSELVES, INTERNALLY WE ASKED OURSELVES OVER HERE, "OKAY,
WHAT DOES A PANCREAS DO?" AND THE ANSWER WAS, "DOES I MAKE PIRATES?" NO, IT
MAKES INSULIN, YOU KNOW? SO, WE'RE STARTING WITH A NEW THOSE GUYS ARE INSIDE
ME, HUH? LIKE, BUILDING A PARK? Rick: THOSE GUYS ARE INSIDE YOU BUILDING A PCE
OF SHIT, ETHAN! THEY'RE INSIDE YOU BUILDING A MONUMENT TO COMPROMISE!
[BLEEP]'EM.
[BLEEP] THOSE PEOPLE.
[BLEEP] THIS WHOLE THING, ETHAN.

AND WHO PAYS ME? 

1 Rick: t-t-t-this is just Sloppy craftsmanship.
Morty: hey, Rick.
Boy, sure is really especially Beautiful out there today, huh? Rick: oh, yes,

Morty: what's with mom? Rick: oh, what's with mom? So, you're saying that she's
Acting weird? How soph[burps]isticated.
Careful, guys.
You're gonna burn out the cpu With this one.
Morty: okay, you know what, Rick? You'reacting weird, too.
Rick: whatever, Quote-unquote "Morty.
" Morty: all right, well I'll see you after school.
Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I'm all right.
I'm okay.
Rick: [ slurps ] All right, who can tell me What 5 x 9 is? [ students
whispering ] Morty? Morty: uh, me? What is 5 x 9? Morty: ummyou know, it's
Uhhat least 40.
[ students gasp ] Morty, that's exactly Correct! Come up here.
Whoo! Way to go, Morty! Everybody, this is the best Student.
I want youto be the teacher Today.
Teach us, Morty! Rick: interesting.
Morty: w-w-w-what do you want Me to teach you? Ooh, ooh! How do you make
concentrated Dark matter? Oh, that's a good question.
Morty: concentrated huh? Concentrated dark matter The fuel for accelerated
space Travel.
Now, do you know how to make it? Morty: umm Come on, Morty.
Isn't your grandpa, like, a Scientist? Morty: oh, yeah, but, you Know, he told
me that i Shouldn't go around spouting off About, you know, his science and
Stuff.
I bet you've seen him make Concentrated dark matter a lot.
You know, if you tell us, i'll Be your girlfriend.
Morty: uh, y-you will? Seems like a rare Opportunity, Morty.
[ blam! ] Rick: Morty, u-uh, come on.
There's a family emergency.

" Rick: he doesn't care.
Morty: aw, man! Rick, i have to go back! I think i was about to get Married!
Ugh! Rick: take a shower with me, Morty.
Morty: what?! Rick: listen to me, Morty.
Get your clothes off and get in The shower right now.
Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty.
Morty: ugh! I'm gonna get an "f" in class, Rick.
Rick: Morty, that's not Class.
T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher.
This isn't your school.
This entire world is not the World.
We're inside a huge simulation Chamber on an alien spaceship.
Morty: wait a minute.
W-what are you talking about? Rick: it's all fake [burps] Morty all of it.
Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of Crazy fake nonsense, Morty.
I couldn't say so until we got In the shower.
They won't monitor us in here.
Morty: monitor us?! W-who?! Rick: zigerion scammers, Morty the galaxy's most
Ambitious, least successful con Artists.
You know, it's lucky for us They're also really Uncomfortable with nudity.
Morty: aw, come on, Rick.
If everyone's just gonna be Insane today, at least let me be Insane with
jessica.
Rick: i can't [burps] let you Do that, Morty.
Morty: give it to me! Rick: no! [ burps ] You give it to me! Morty: g-g-give
it! No, Rick! [ aliens groaning ] Oh, god, sir! They're still naked! Ugh.
Well, check every five quintons And tell me when they're not.
I think we should make kevin Look, sir.
What?! No! W-w-why would you even say that? Uh, sir, we have a situation Over
here.
If there's a wiener on that Monitor, i swear to god, stu Something is drawing a
lot of Processing power.
Oh, wait.
No wonder.
There's another real human in The simulator.
Jerry: okay, Jerry big Pitch meeting.
Make-or-break time.
[ whirrin] You can do this.
How did this happen?! Where's the abductions Department? Hey, man, abductions
just Follows the acquisition order.
Don't put this on Acquisitions! We only acquire humans that Haven'tbeen
simulated! Well, simulations doesn't Simulate anybody that's been Abducted, so
[chuckles] Oh, i see! Oh, oh! It was no one's fault.
Oh, okay.
[ chuckles ] I'm sorry.
Well, then, problem solved.
Oh, wait no.
There's still another human in Here! Who is he? Rick's son-in-law, Jerry smith.
So far, he hasn't noticed he's In a simulation.
[ sighs ] Well, cap his sector at 5% Processing, keep his settings on Auto, and
we'll deal with him Later.
Rick sanchez is the target.
Jerry: [ inhales deeply ] Got to relax.
It's just a pitch.
Got to relax.
[ click ] [ static ] This is earth radio.
And now, here'shuman music.
[ repetitive rhythmic beepin] Jerry: hmm.
Human music.
I like it.
[ beeping continue] [ Rick and Morty panting ] Morty: Rick! Rick: uhp, uhp,
uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your Ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak
Freely.
Look around you, Morty.
Do you really think this [burps] World is real? You'd have to be an idiot not
to Notice all the sloppy details.
Look that guy's putting a bun Between two hot dogs.
Morty: i don't know, Rick.
I mean, i've seen people do that Before.
Rick: well, look at that old Lady.
She's she's walking a cat on A leash.
Morty: uh, mrs.
Spencer does That all the time, Rick.
Rick: look, i-i-i don't want To hear about mrs.
Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! All right, all right, there.
W-what about that, Morty? Morty: okay, okay, you got me On that one.
Rick: oh, really,Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen That somewhere in real
life Before? Morty: no, no.
I haven't seen that.
I mean, why would a pop tart Want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that
would be, like, the Scariest place for them to live.
You know what i mean? Rick: you're missing the Point, Morty.
Why would he drive a smaller Toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look
like A smaller version of your house? No.
Morty: so, why are they doing This? W-what do they want? Rick: well, that would
be Obvious to you, Morty, if you'd Been paying attention.
[ siren wails ] [ tires screech ] We got the president of the United states in
here! We need 10cc of concentrated Dark matter, stat, or he'll die! Morty:
concentrated dark Matter? They were asking about that in Class.
Rick: yeah, it's a special Fuel i invented to travel Through space faster than
Anybody else.
These zigerions are always Trying to scam me out of my Secrets, but they made a
big Mistake this time, Morty.
They dragged youinto this.
Now they're gonna pay! Morty: what do you W-w-what are we gonna do? Rick: we'll
scam the Scammers, Morty.
And we're gonna take them for Everything they've got.
Jerry: national apple farmers Of america, welcome to our ad Agency.
I'm Jerry smith.
All right.
I'll justget to the pitch.
Um, simple question, gentlemen, [ hoarsely ] what are apples? [ clears throat ]
excuse me.
Ahh.
[ coughs, clears throat ] What are apples? Apples are food.
Andwhen do we need food? When we're hungry.
With that, i give you your new Slogan! [ sighs ] Well, say something! Do you
like it? Yes.
Jerry: you do? All: yes.
Jerry: soi sold it? [ laughs ] i sold the idea? All: yes.
Jerry: oh, my god! Thank you! Together: thank you.
You're welcome.
[ "baker street" plays ] Jerry: hey! I just sold my first pitch! [ dialing ]
Slow down! Lookin' good.
My man! [ beeping, telephone ringing ] Robot Beth: hello.
Jerry: guess who just sold The apples campaign.
Robot Beth: who just sold the Apples campaign? Jerry: me! I guess it wasn't a
rip-off of "got milk?" after all.
Guess someonewas wrong.
Robot Beth: yes.
Jerry: well, all is forgiven, Because right now, i've got an Erection the size
of an East coast lighthouse, and i'm Coming home to share it with my Beautiful
wife.
Robot Beth: okay.
Jerry: wait really? Robot Beth: yes.
Jerry: yes! See you in 10 minutes! [ cellphone beeps ] Hey! I'm going to make
love to my Wife! Lookin' good.
Slow down! My man! [ beeping ] Morty: aw, geez, Rick.
I-i don't know if i like this Plan, you know? I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have A
tendency to make me really Nervous.
Rick: Morty, relax.
It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s Out there.
You're gonna be fine.
Just follow my lead.
Yo, deejay, drop that beat.
[ hip-hop beat plays ] [ cheers and applause ] Uh-oh, Morty.
This crowd looks too small for One of ourfamous rap concerts.
I don't think we can perform our New song, "the recipe for Concentrated dark
matter," for a Crowd this tiny.
Morty: you got that right, Rick.
[ cheers and applause ] Rick: now that's [burps] More like it! Morty, here we
go.
Let me hear everybody say "hey-oh!" yeah! [ crowd cheering ] All the ladies
say, "yeah!" [ ladies cheering ] Everybody over 30, do this with Your hands!
Everybody with a red shirt, jump Up and down! [ beeping ] [ tires screech ]
Jerry: mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah, don't move.
Mm, mm, mm, mm! Mm! [ cheers and applause ] Rick: yo, everyone whose First name
begins with an "l" Who isn't hispanic, walk in a Circle the same number of
times As the square root of your age Times 10! [ beeping ] Run, Morty! Before
the system reboots! [ squeaking ] Jerry: yeah! You like that? Now who's
unremarkable? You hungry for apples? [ squeaking intensifies ] Are you
hungryforapples?! [ squeaking stops ] [ sighs deeply ] [ chuckles ] Oh, my god.
That's the best sex i've ever Had in my life.
It'sit'stoo good.
I don't deserve this, Beth.
I'm a fraud.
Morty: oh, man, Rick! W-w-w-where we running to? Rick: out of the simulation,
Morty.
Normally, the chamber operates Like a treadmill, with the Virtual world
disappearing Behind us and being rendered in Front of us as we move through It,
but while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to The edge.
Here we go.
Morty: holy crap! Rick: come on, Morty.
Morty: [ grunts ] Sir, they're over the edge.
Yes, they are.
Justasplanned.
[ evil laughter ] Oh, this is going to be such a Mind [bleep] Rick: keep your
eyes peeled For the central processing room, Morty.
That's how we're gonna scam These idiots.
Morty: so, hey, why do these Aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so
much smarter Than them? Rick: it's an obsession for Them at this point.
The zi[burps]gerions have been Trying to outsmart me for years, Morty.
Every time they do, i'm one step Ahead of them.
Aha! Here we go.
Grab as many processors as you Can carry, Morty.
These guys aren't good at much, But they're reallygood at Making these chips.
Morty: i've got so many, i Can barely hold them all.
[ chuckles ] Look at look at this.
Oops.
I dropped one.
Rick: don't worry about it, Morty.
There's plenty of them, you Little goofball.
[ both laugh ] Come here, Morty! Oh, i gotcha! Morty: come on, quit it, Rick!
Quit it! [ laughs ] Rick: nothing wrong with just A little bit of horseplay
every Now and then, little fella.
[ glass shatters ] Morty: wow.
What do you know? Huh.
That was easy.
Rick: totes malotes, dawg.
Morty: just kind of hard to Believe, you know? Rick: believe it, Morty.
And once again, i'm flying away With everything i can carry, and The zigerions
got nothing of Mine.
Jerry: [ sighs ] Mr.
Marklevitz, do you have a Minute to talk? [ snaps fingers ] yes.
Jerry: look, i'm a fraud.
I mean, let's face it "hungry for apples" is just a Rip-off of "got milk?" It's
almost identical.
[ snaps fingers ] yes.
Jerry: [ sighs ] okay.
I deserve that.
Ummi guessi'll just pack Up my desk.
[ snaps fingers ] yes.
Jerry: [ crying ] [ sobbing ] oh, my god.
Wait.
You know what?! No! The milk people don't have a Patent on simple rhetorical
Questions! There's not even a single word In "hungry for apples" that's Shared

It's different! And i shouldn't be fired.
I should be promoted! [ snaps fingers ] yes.
Jerry: yeah! Wait.
Really? [ snaps fingers ] yes.
Jerry: yes! I mean, i'm it may be Derivative, but it's the most Successful
campaign to come out Of thagency in a long time.
[ snaps fingers ] yes.
Jerry: i-i'm not saying it Should win an award for Commercials, but it could
Certainly be nominatedfor an Award for commercials Specifically about apples,
Likean appley or something.

Jerry: is there really an Award called the appley for Apple-related ad
campaigns? [ snaps fingers ] yes.
Jerry: could we nominate me? [ snaps fingers ] yes.
Jerry: holy crap! [ beeping ] Rick: get in, Morty.
I'm gonna [burps] be able to use These processors to make some Real important
science stuff.
[ keypad beeping ] Huh.
I thought i entered the code Right.
[ keypad beeping ] Wha well, what's this? W-what could this possibly be?
Because it looks like you're Inside a simulation Inside a simulation.
You're still on the ship.
Game-day bucket go boom.
Sir, the, uh, doctor's Appointment to examine the Discoloration on your
butthole Flaps was Too loud, cynthia.
Too loud and too specific.
Rick: uhh [ chuckles ] We've known how to make Concentrated dark matter for a
Long time.
But now we alsoknow the code to Your fabled safe, Rick sanchez! All your most
valuable secrets Will now be ours! Rick: uh, yeah, until i get Home before you
and change the Combination, you bunch of Idiots! That is why you're never
Getting home.

Lasers.
[ beeping ] [ slurps ] [ gasps ] [ alarm blaring ] Morty: oh, man! They're hot
on our tail, Rick! Rick: i guess they really do Have concentrated dark matter.
Morty: well, you know how to Make it, too, right, Rick? Rick: yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, check the engine room.
We just need cesium, plutonic Quarks, and bottled water.
Morty: it's all here, Rick! Rick: wow, Morty.
Lucky break.
Grab that bucket.
Okay, two parts plutonic quarks, One part cesium.
Morty: okay.
Uh-huh.
[ fizzing ] All right.
Rick: now empty the water Bottle into the bucket and pour It all into the fuel
tank so we Can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no
time! [ beeping ] Morty: [ stammering ] Rick: oh, no.
Jerry: what the Rick: no! [ laughter ] Oh, my god, Rick.
How dumb are you? You're inside a simulation Of a simulation Inside another
giant simulation! [ laughs ] W-we never had the recipe for Concentrated dark
matter.
But we do now! We do now, sucka! Rick: you simulated my Grandson's genitalia?!
Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons Of bitches! Kevin fought real hard to
Supervise that project.
You said you weren't gonna Tell anyone! I'm never gonna live this down, Am i?
Rick: all right.
Okay.
All right, great.
Wonderful.
You win.
Can we go home now? I don't know.
Canyou? Ha! Nice.
Okay, okay.
Show this gullible turd to his Shuttle.
I'm done with him.
Oh, wait.
Let me get a picture.
[ shutter clicks ] Aww.
Look at his face.
He's trying to figure out if He's in a simulation still.
Are you, Rick? Are you? [ laughs ] You're not.
Or ayou? Oh, a-and, by the way, i don't Have discolored butthole flaps.
That was part of the simulation.
Oh.
Uh, sir, should i cancel that Appointment, then? Yeah! Of course you should! [
chuckles ] No, keep it.
Move it up, actually, if you Can.
Rick: hey, Jerry, don't worry About it.
So what if the most meaningful Day of your life was a Simulation operating at
minimum Cap[burps]acity? Jerry: you know what, Rick? Those guys took youfor a
ride, Too.
You should try having a little Respect for the dummies of the Universe, now
that you're one of Us.
Rick: maybe you're right, Jerry.
Maybe you're right.
[ aliens cheering ] [ dance music plays ] All right, everybody.
Two parts plutonic quarks One part cesium [ fizzing ] A-and listen, i'm sorry
for Ãling earlier.
I-i couldn't ask for a better Staff.
I love you guys, and i love all Your families.
And the final ingredient Jerry: whoa! What the hell?! W-what happened back
there? Rick: why don't you ask the Smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh,
yeah.

sync ] [ "baker street" continues ] Jerry: so What do you think? You're fired.
Jerry: wha But t-this idea was tested in a State-of-the-art simulation.
Well, then, it was a terrible Simulation.
Get out.
[ door opens, closes ] Man, how does a guy like that go Home and have sex with

Morty: AHEM.
EXCUSE ME! WE ARE TWO HUMBLE HEROES IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURE! Rick: OH, MY GOD,
SO EMBARRASSING.
AT LAST! TWO HEROES! YOU MUST HELP US! THIS VILLAGE IS TERRIBLY POOR, YET THE
GIANT THAT LIVES IN THE CLOUDS ABOVE HAS UNTOLD TREASURES! Morty: YOU KNOW
WHAT? I-I-I ACCEPT YOUR CALL TO ADVENTURE, GOOD SIR, KIND SIR.
COME ON, RICK.
THERE'S A GIANT IN THE CLOUDS! Rick: YEAH.
[ BURPS ] BEGINNER'S LUCK.
IN CONCLUSION, A FRIENDSHIP WITH SUMMER SMITH IS THE MOS VALUABLE AND ENRICHING
EXPERIENCE OF YOUR YOUNG LIVES.
[ APPLAUSE ] I'M MR.

I MEAN, I STILL PUT MYSELF THROUGH VETERINARY SCHOOL.
YES, I'M SUCCESSFUL, BUT WHAT IF I HADN'T I'M JUST SAYING, SOMEWHERE ALONG THE
WAY, I LOST THAT WIDE-EYED GIRL FROM MUSKEGON.
SHE'S STILL THERE, BETH.
Beth: WELL, HER WAISTLINE ISN'T.
[ LAUGHS ] BETH, HAVING A FAMILY DOESN' MEAN THAT YOU STOP BEING AN INDIVIDUAL.
YOU KNOW THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO FOR PEOPLE THAT DEPEND ON YOU? BE HONEST
WITH THEM, EVEN IF I MEANS SETTING THEM FREE.
Beth: YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD LEAVE JERRY.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M FINALLY HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.
[ ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS ] MORE WINE? Beth: [ CLEARS THROAT ] I THINK I'VE HAD
ENOUGH.
Jerry: [ GRUNTS ] REMEMBER TO SQUARE YOUR SHOULDERS, JERRY.
Jerry: YEAH, YEAH.
I GOT IT.
[ GRUNTS ] THAT'S OKAY.
I'M MR.
MEESEEKS! LOOK AT ME! TRY AGAIN AND KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.
Jerry: OKAY, WELL, WHICH IS IT? SQUARE MY SHOULDERS OR KEEP MY HEAD DOWN? WELL,
IT'S BOTH.
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, YOU GOT TO RELAX.
Jerry: YOU KNOW WHAT, MR.
MEESEEKS? I DON'T THINK THIS IS WORKING.
I GIVE UP.
I'M SORRY, JERRY, BUT I DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.
I'M MR.
MEESEEKS.
I HAVE TO FULFILL MY PURPOSE SO I CAN GO AWAY.
LOOK AT ME.
Jerry: WELL, MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE, BECAUSE I SUCK.
NO, JERRY, I'M THE ONE WHO SUCKS! LET ME TRY SOMETHING.
I'M MR.
MEESEEKS! LOOK AT ME! HI, MR.

MUSIC PLAYING ] [ BOTH GRUNT ] Rick: ALL RIGHT, MORTY.
W-W-WE'RE IN YOUR STUPID GIANT'S CASTLE.
W-WHAT DO WE DO NEXT? Morty: WOULD YOU JUST RELAX, RICK? ALL WE GOT TO DO IS
FIND THE TREASURE ROOM, OKAY? IT'S NICE AND SIMPLE.
YOU KNOW, I-I-I'M SORRY EVERYTHING'S GOING SO SMOOTHLY AND ADVENTUROUSLY.
[ FOOTSTEPS BOOMING ] Rick: UH-OH, MORTY.
STARTIN' TO GET A LITTLE HAIRY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, BOSS? Morty: COME ON, HURRY.
BEHIND THIS COOKIE JAR.
FEE! FI! FO! FUM! Rick: JUST GIVE UP, MORTY.
J-J-J THIS IS GAME OVER.
I'LL TAKE US HOME RIGHT NOW.
YOU JUST SAY THE WORD.
Morty: NO WAY, RICK.
THIS IS ALL PART OF IT.
ADVENTURES HAVE CONFLICT.
DEAL WITH IT.
I SMELL THE BLOOD OF WHOOP! [ CRUNCH ] [ GROANING ] Morty: HOLY CRAP.
Rick: OH, BOY.
HE LOOKS PRETTY BAD DOWN THERE, MORTY.
LOOKS LIKE HE'S BLEEDING OUT.
OH, JESUS! DALE! YOU SONS OF BITCHES! Morty: OH, MAN.
Rick: UH-OH.
[ Speed-dialing ] HELLO, 911? MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN ATTACKED BY TINY PEOPLE! HE'S
DYING! [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ] HEY, LOOK, WE GET IT.
YOU'RE LITTLE, YOU'RE DOWN ON YOUR LUCK, YOU THINK, "HEY, HE'S A GIANT.
WHY DON'T WE BREAK INTO HIS HOME, ROB HIM, AND MURDER HIM?" Morty: TH-TH BUT
THAT'S NO HOW IT WENT DOWN! OH, WELL, IT'S GOING DOWN LIKE THAT.
YOU'RE BOTH GOING DOWN LIKE THAT.
Rick: OOH, BOY, MORTY, YOU'RE REALLY SHOWING ME HOW IT'S DONE.
RE[BURPS]AL STRAIGHTFORWARD AND FUN.
Summer: LIKE, LETTING GO OF THE NEED TO BE POPULAR IS WHA MAKES PEOPLE LIKE
YOU.
Beth: THE MOST IMPORTANT LOVE YOU CAN RECEIVE IS FROM YOURSELF.
OKAY, JERRY, YOU GOT TO JUS CHOKE UP ON THE CLUB! Jerry: WELL, WHICH IS IT,
CHOKE UP OR FOLLOW-THROUGH?! AWW, COME ON, JERRY, WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.
YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO DO BOTH! THIS IS AS FRUSTRATING FOR US AS IT IS FOR YOU.
Jerry: DON'T TELL ME THAT! THAT JUST PUTS PRESSURE ON ME! JUST TRY TO RELAX.
Jerry: YOU TRY TO RELAX! HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO RELAX?! IT IS A PARADOX! UGH,
THESE MEESEEKS, HUH? KIND OF A HANDFUL.
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT YOU TWO MUST BE GOING THROUGH.
Beth: OUR MEESEEKS HAVE BEEN GONE FOR HOURS, JERRY.
Jerry: YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
Beth: NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT? Jerry: I-I-I'M SORRY.
HOURS? Summer: DAD, MOM IS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN! LOOK AT HER! YOU WILL LOSE HER!
Jerry: UHH HEY, JERRY, YOU MIND IF WE GET BACK TO THE TASK AT HAND? MEESEEKS
DON'T USUALLY HAVE TO EXIST THIS LONG.
IT'S GETTING WEIRD.
ORDER IN THE COURT! BEFORE THE JURY REACHES ITS VERDICT, I JUST WANT TO SAY THA
I CONSIDER YOU BOTH VERY GUILTY.
Rick: OH, GREAT ADVENTURE, BUDDY.
RICK AND MORTY GO TO GIAN PRISON.
YOU KNOW, IF SOMEBODY DROPS THE SOAP, IT'S GONNA LAND ON OUR HEADS AND CRUSH
OUR SPINES, MORTY.
YOU KNOW, I-I-I-IT'LL BE REALLY EASY TO RAPE US AFTER THAT.
Morty: WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY, RICK.
Rick: HOW? THEY TOOK MY PORTAL GUN.
THIS IS AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE, MORTY.
YOU KNOW, W-W-W-WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GONNA HAPPEN, SOME MAGICAL ANGEL'S GONNA
SHOW UP AND THEN FEE! FI! FO! FUM! I SMELL THE VIOLATION OF CIVIL LIBERTIES!
YOUR HONOR, I'M FROM A TINY-PERSONS ADVOCACY GROUP AND I HAVE HERE IN MY HAND A
MOTION TO DISMISS.
THESE LITTLE MEN WERE NEVER READ THEIR GIANT RIGHTS AND ARE THEREFORE FREE-FI
TO FO-HOME.
Rick: W-WHAT THE HELL IS HE TALKING ABOUT? THEY'RE FREE TO GO, IS WHAT I MEANT.
I-I-I'M DECONSTRUCTING OUR OUR OUR THING WE SAY.
WE'RE GIANTS.
NOBODY GOT THAT? WHATEVER.
Morty: OH, MAN, WHAT DID I TELL YOU, RICK? WE DID IT! Rick: ALL RIGHT, MORTY,
LOOKS LIKE THE PORTAL GUN'S STILL WORKING.
YOU READY TO HEAD HOME? Morty: OH, YEAH, YOU'D LIKE THAT, WOULDN'T YOU, RICK?
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE NOT BAILING OUT JUST YET.
YOU KNOW, W-WE'RE GONNA GO FIND SOME TREASURE OR OR SOMETHING AND AND WE'RE
GONNA BRING I TO THOSE VILLAGERS.
Rick: MORTY, CUT YOUR LOSSES.
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A WASH.
Morty: YEAH, YOU WERE SAYING THAT BACK BACK W-W-W-WHEN WE FIRST GOT ARRESTED,
BUT HERE WE ARE, YOU KNOW, WALKING DOWN THE COURTHOUSE STEPS.
[ EAGLE SCREECHES ] Rick: OH, BOY, MORTY.
Morty: USUALLY, WALKING DOWN THE COURTHOUSE STEPS IS THE EASY PART OF THE
ADVENTURE.
Rick: WHAT DO YOU SAY, MORTY? Morty: I SAY GIVE ME A HAND, SIDEKICK.
Rick: [ SIGHS ] [ MEESEEKS Ã©LING ] Jerry: EVERYBODY SHUT UP! LET ME TRY! [
GRUNTS ] DAMN IT! DAMN IT! DAMN IT! Beth: I'M GOING OUT.
Jerry: WAIT.
WHAT? Beth: WELL, YOU'RE BUSY.
I'M HUNGRY.
I THOUGHT I'D GO OUT.
DO YOU WANT ME TO BE HAPPY OR DO YOU WANT ME TO BE IN PRISON? Jerry: WHOA,
WHOA, WHERE IN THE HELL IS I'LL TAKE YOU TO DINNER.
[ MEESEEKS Ã©L ] HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S HARD BEING ME, TOO.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
Beth: [ SIGHS ] [ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ] Jerry: LOOK, I'VE GOT A MARRIAGE TO KEEP
TOGETHER.
AT THIS POINT, MY GOLF SWING IS MORE YOUR PROBLEM THAN MINE.
[ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ] I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
I JUST WANT TO DIE! WE ALL WANT TO DIE! WE'RE MEESEEKS! WHY DID YOU EVEN ROPE
ME INTO THIS? 'CAUSE HE ROPED ME INTO THIS! WELL, HIM OVER THERE, HE ROPED ME
INTO THIS! WELL, HE ROPED ME INTO THIS! WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME? HE HE ROPED ME
INTO THIS.
WELL, THAT ONE OVER THERE ROPED ME INTO THIS.
WELL, HE ROPED ME INTO THIS.
[ BOTH GRUNTING ] Rick: YEAH, MORTY, THIS IS THE PART OF THE STORY EVERYBODY
LOVES SCALING DOWN 650,000 OVERSIZED STEPS.
Morty: ALL RIGHT, OKAY, Y-YOU KNOW, IF THIS WAS A STORY, THIS PART WOULDN'T BE
INCLUDED, STUPID.
HEY, RICK, W-W-W-W-W-WHAT DO YOU KNOW? LOOK DOWN THERE.
LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF TAVERN OR SOMETHING BUILT RIGHT INTO THE SIDE OF THE
STEP.
[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] OH, WOW, RICK.
NOW, THIS IS MORE LIKE IT.
LOOK, THERE'S LITTLE STAIRCASE-SHAPED PEOPLE IN HERE.
A-ALL KINDS OF CRAZY CHARACTERS.
THIS PLACE IS GREAT, YOU KNOW? IT'S WHIMSICAL AND FUN.
Rick: WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT, MOTHER[BLEEP] Morty: EASY, RICK.
PAY THEM NO MIND.
THOSE STAIR GOBLINS CAN BE MOODY.
NOW, WHAT CAN I GETCHA? WE'VE GOT SKARLOG POPPIES, FLURLOW, HALZINGERS,
BLOOGIES, JUICY TIME BABIES.
Rick: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, H-HOW ABOUT SOME SCOTCH WHISKEY? YOU GOT ANY OF THAT
AROUND HERE? OR JUST A BUNCH OF NONSENSE WORDS? Morty: RICK.
WE'LL HAVE TWO BLOOGIES, PLEASE.
AND, UH, WE WERE WONDERING, IS THERE A FASTER WAY TWO HEROES COULD GET DOWN
THESE STAIRS? Y'ALL NEED TO RIDE DOWN THE STAIRS? MY NAME IS SLIPPELY-SLIPPERY
STAIR.
I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN THERE FOR 25 SHMECKELS.
Rick: 25 SHMECKELS? I-I-I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
IS THAT A LOT? IS IT A LITTLE? THAT'S EXACTLY HOW MUCH I SPENT ON MY BIG FAKE
BOOBIES.
HI, I'M MR.
BOOBY BUYER.
I'LL BUY THOSE BOOBIES FOR 25 SHMECKELS.
IT'S A TEMPTING OFFER, BU I'M GONNA HAVE TO DECLINE.
RATS! WHAT A SHAME.
Rick: MORTY, YOUR ADVENTURE'S IN A SPIRAL.
FOR REAL, MAN, TIME TO PULL OUT.
Morty: YOU KEEP HECKLING MY ADVENTURE, RICK! YOU KNOW WHY? Rick: UH, BECAUSE
IT'S LAME? Morty: IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE PETTY! YOU KNOW, H-HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I
HAD TO FOLLOW YOU INTO SOME NONSENSICAL BULL CRAP? I ALWAYS ROLL WITH THE
PUNCHES, RICK.
WHY CAN'T YOU? LOOK, I GOT TO TAKE A LEAK, AND WHEN I COME BACK, I-IF YOU
HAVEN'T LEARNED HOW TO LIGHTEN UP, DON'T BE HERE! Rick: WHATEVER.
IT'S BECOME CLEAR LOOK A ME THAT IF WE CONCENTRATE ALL OUR EFFORTS ON JERRY'S
FOLLOW-THROUGH, WE WILL SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.
I'M MR.
MEESEEKS.
I'M MR.
MEESEEKS.
LOOK AT ME.
THE ONLY THING THAT'S CLEAR IS THAT CHOKING UP IS THE ONE TRUE SOLUTION.
LOOK AT ME.
I'M MR.
MEESEEKS.
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO HELP JERRY FOR TWO DAYS, AN ETERNITY IN MEESEEKS TIME, AND
NOTHING'S WORKED.
I FEAR THE WORST.
YOUR FAILURES ARE YOUR OWN, OLD MAN.
I'M MR.
MEESEEKS! LOOK AT ME.
I SAY FOLLOW-THROUGH! WHO'S WITH ME?! [ MEESEEKS SHOU "FOLLOW-THROUGH" ] I'M
MR.
MEESEEKS! LOOK AT ME! KILL HIM! [ HISSES ] [ MEESEEKS SHOUTING ] HOW ARE YOU
TODAY? I'M MR.
JELLY BEAN.
Morty: HI, MR.
JELLY BEAN.
I'M MORTY.
MY GRANDPA AND I ARE ON AN ADVENTURE.
NICE.
IS IT A FUN ADVENTURE? Morty: I HOPE SO.
BUT I'M STARTING TO GET NERVOUS THAT MAYBE IT'S GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR OFF THE
RAILS.
[ LAUGHS ] ISN'T THAT WHA ADVENTURES DO? Morty: HEY, Y-YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE
RIGHT.
EVERYTHING'S GOING FINE.
I JUST GOT TO RELAX AND GO WITH THE FLOW.
YEAH.
Morty: O-O-OKAY.
UH.
B-BYE.
UHH, NO, STAY.
GO WITH THE FLOW.
Morty: STOP.
Y-Y-YOU'RE MAKING ME REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE.
[ GRUNTS ] STOP FIGHTING ME.
Morty: [ GASPING ] JUST LET THIS HAPPEN.
Morty: GET OFF OF ME! Rick: SWEET HOME ALABAMA WHOO! Morty: [ GASPING ] NO!
STOP! PLEASE! STOP BEING SUCH A [BLEEP] TEASE, YOU SWEET LITTLE [BLEEP] [
MEESEEKS Ã©LING ] Morty: NO! NO! [ GRUNTS ] OW! [ GRUNTING ] Morty: [
PANTING ] [ MEESEEKS Ã©LING ] EVERYBODY STO-O-O-P! LOOK AT ME! MY BROTHERS,
NOTHING WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY SHEDDING MEESEEKS BLOOD.
NONE OF US CAN DIE UNTIL OUR JOB IS DONE.
THE JOB CAN'T BE DONE! WE'LL NEVER GET TWO STROKES OFF HIS GAME! NO, WE WON'T.
BUT WE WILL GET ALL STROKES OFF HIS GAME.
WHERE'S HE GOING WITH THIS? WHAT'S HE MEAN? WHEN WE KILL HIM.
[ MEESEEKS CHEER ] Beth: JERRY, MAYBE IT'S TIME I TAKE THAT TRIP I ALWAYS TALK
ABOUT.
Jerry: WHERE WOULD YOU GO? Beth: I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
ITALY.
GREECE.
ARGENTINA.
Jerry: [ as Carnac ] COUNTRIES KNOWN FOR THEIR SEXUALLY AGGRESSIVE MEN.
[ CHUCKLES ] [ Normal voice ] DID I TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE YOUR NEW HAIRCUT?
[ RUMBLING ] WHAT THE HECK? THERE HE IS! [ CUSTOMERS GASP, MEESEEKS SHOUTING ]
[ GUNSHOT ] Beth: RUN, JERRY! AAH! [ PANTING ] COME ON OUT, JERRY! Jerry: GUYS,

WHAT DO YA GOT? Rick: READ 'EM AND WE[BURPS]EP, FELLAS! All: AW! Rick: OH, HEY,
MORTY.
LISTEN, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOU ALL THAT STUFF I SAID EARLIER ABOUT YOUR
ADVENTURE.
I-I-I'M HAVIN' A GOOD TIME, MORTY.
IT'S NOT SO BAD.
Morty: LET'S JUST GO HOME, OKAY? I'M CALLING IT.
THE ADVENTURE'S OVER.
Rick: WE CAN'T LEAVE NOW, MORTY.
I'M ON FIRE! Morty: LOOK, I WANT TO LEAVE NOW.
YOU WIN THE BET, OKAY? JUST GIVE ME THE PORTAL GUN AND LET'S GO, PLEASE.
[ GROANS ] Morty: PLEASE, I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.
Rick: OKAY.
LISTEN, MORTY.
I JUST WON A BUNCH OF SHMECKELS.
WHY DON'T WE USE 25 OF THEM TO PAY SLIPPERY STAIR HERE FOR A RIDE BACK TO THE
VILLAGE, AND THEN WE'LL GIVE THE REST OF THE SHMECKELS TO THE VILLAGERS, HUH?
Morty: REALLY? Rick: SURE, MORTY.
YEAH.
YOU KNOW, A GOOD ADVENTURE NEEDS A GOOD ENDING.
Morty: [ GRUNTS ] [ COUGHS ] BUCKLE UP! MEESEEKS ARE NOT BORN INTO THIS WORLD
FUMBLING FOR MEANING, JERRY! WE ARE CREATED TO SERVE A SINGULAR PURPOSE FOR
WHICH WE WILL GO TO ANY LENGTHS TO FULFILL! EXISTENCE IS PAIN TO A MEESEEKS,
JERRY.
AND WE WILL DO ANYTHING TO ALLEVIATE THAT PAIN.
JUST ASK AAH! WHAT'S YOUR NAME, MA'AM? S-SAMANTHA.
PLEASE, MISTER! GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS! Jerry: INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE
BECAUSE OF ME.
WHY AM I SO MEDIOCRE? [ CRASH! ] Beth: JERRY, TURN AROUND.
STRAIGHTEN YOUR BACK.
BEND YOUR KNEES.
BEND THEM.
SQUARE YOUR SHOULDERS.
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
I LOVE YOU.
I'M COUNTING TO THREE, JERRY.
[ DOOR BANGS ] [ HEROIC MUSIC PLAYING ] [ CLINK ] [ MEESEEKS "OOH" ] WHAT THE
[BLEEP] IS GOING ON? [ MEESEEKS CHEER ] HE'S GOT IT! TH-TH-THAT'S A LOWER
HANDICAP STRO-O-KE! [ MEESEEKS CHEER ] EXCUSE ME.
I'M A BIT OF A STICKLER MEESEEKS.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR SHORT GAME? OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD! [ Crying ] WHAT ABOUT YOUR
SHOR GAME?! [ PLINK ] OOH, NICE! [ BOTH MOAN ] Jerry: I THINK WE'LL TAKE OUR
FOOD TO GO.
NO, YOU WON'T.
THE POLICE ARE COMING.
YOU HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS TO ANSWER.
Jerry: FAIR ENOUGH.
[ VILLAGERS CHEER ] [ CHICKEN SQUAWKS ] THANK YOU, KIND SIR.
OUR VILLAGE IS SAVED! YOU ARE BOTH TRUE HEROES! Morty: OH! [ LAUGHS ] Rick:
GOOD JOB, MORTY.
LOOKS LIKE YOU WON THE BET.
Morty: THANKS, RICK, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD.
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE RIGHT ABOU THE UNIVERSE.
IT'S A CRAZY AND CHAOTIC PLACE.
Rick: WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE THAT'S WHY IT COULD USE A LITTLE CLEANING UP
[BURPS] EVERY NOW AND THEN, YOU KNOW.
THIS ONE'S WRAPPED UP NEAT AND CLEAN BECAUSE WE DID IT MORTY STYLE.
OH! HEROES, WE WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR BELOVED KING SO THAT HE MAY
THANK YOU PERSONALLY.
Morty: UH, NO, I-IT'S COOL.
RICK.
PORTAL.
HURRY.
AAH! [ VILLAGERS SCREAM ] Jerry: SO YOU STILL THINKING ABOUT TAKING THAT TRIP?
Beth: [ SIGHS ] JERRY, LOOK.
WE DON'T HAVE A PERFEC MARRIAGE, BUT I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
WHEN WE WERE IN THAT FREEZER, I REALIZED THE MEESEEKS ARE LIKE THE GUYS I WENT
TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH WILLING TO SAY ANYTHING TO "COMPLETE THEIR TASK.
" Jerry: WAS I ONE OF THOSE GUYS? Beth: THE DIFFERENCE IS YOU DIDN'T DISAPPEAR
AFTERWARDS.
Jerry: WELL I GOT YOU PREGNANT.
Beth: YEAH Rick: WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE? Beth: UH, YOUR MEESEEKS
BOX HAPPENED.
THEY WENT CRAZY WHEN THEY COULDN'T TAKE TWO STROKES OFF JERRY'S GOLF GAME.
HE FELT TERRIBLE.
Rick: HEY, IT'S NOT MY FAUL THAT JERRY'S AN IDIOT.
Beth: DAD! IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO CLEAN THIS PLACE UP? Rick: WELL, YOU
KNOW, I DO HAVE A FLEESEEKS BOX.
Jerry: NO.
NO MORE BOXES.
Rick: WHAT? IT JUST HAS A MOP AND SOME FLOOR WAX IN IT.
WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUBS! [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH! THAT'S MY NEW THING! I'M KIND OF LIKE
WHAT'S HIS NAME AR-ARSENIO.
ISN'T THAT IT'S WHAT ARSENIO USED TO SAY ON HIS SHOW.
WOBBLE GOBBA LOP BOPS! RIGHT? SEE YOU NEXT WEEK, EVERYBODY.
Beth: I DON'T GET IT.
[ RAPID FOOTSTEPS ] [ PANTING ] SIR, I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SEE THIS.
WE FOUND IT INSIDE A LOCKBOX INSIDE KING JELLY BEAN'S CLOSET.
[ RETCHES ] WE HAVE TO TELL THE PEOPLE.
WAIT.
DESTROY IT.
OUR PEOPLE WILL GET MORE FROM THE IDEA HE REPRESENTED THAN FROM THE JELLY BEAN
HE ACTUALLY WAS.

1 Principal vagina here don't let the name fool you.
I'm very much in charge reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season
dance.
I don't know how many times i have to say this, but if you have the flu, stay
home.
Hey.
The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration.
Morty: [sighs] you don't bring dead babies to passover.
Morty: okay.
Here we go.
H-hey, Jessica.
Uh what's up, Morty? [Sneezes] what are you doing? Morty: um wait, wait.
Were you about to talk to her? Morty: well I mean, I was thinking about it.
Dude, stay in your league.
Look at how hot she is.
You don't see me going to a bigger school in a wealthier district and hitting
on their prettiest girl.
Gee, thanks, brad.
I throw balls far.
You want good words? Date a languager.
Jerry: try not to worry about it, Morty.
You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be
getting girls sometime after brad's out of shape.
Morty: [sighing] you're missing the point, dad.
I don't want girls.
I want Jessica.
Jerry: ah, well, I remember feeling that way about a young lady named "your
mom," and that's not an urban diss.
Your mom was my Jessica.
I remember the first time I saw her.
I thought Rick: "i should get her pregnant, and then she'll have to marry me.
" Jerry: I beg your pardon, Rick inappropriate.
Rick: sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high
school.
I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty.
His marriage is hanging from a thread.
Jerry: my marriage is fine, thank you.
Rick: Jerry, it's your house whatever you say it is is how it is but I think a
blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door.
I barely have a reason to care, and even inoticed.
Morty: come on, Rick! Don't talk about my parents like that.
Rick: listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call "love" is
just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed.
It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing
marriage.
I did it.
Your parents are gonna do it.
Break the cycle, Morty.
Rise above.
Focus on science.
[Slurps] Morty: all right, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance.
Jerry: yeah, I'm just going to check on your mom.
Rick: Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh? I'm almost finished making my ionic
defibulizer, Morty.
It's gonna be great.
Morty: hey, listen, Rick.
Y-y-you know how you said that, you know, love is a chemical and all that stuff
from earlier? Well, I was thinking, you know, w-w could you make some sort of
chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in
love with me and all that sort of thing? You know, like, maybe make some sort
of love potion or something? Rick: Morty, that's such a poor use of my time.
It's beneath me.
Hand me the screwdriver.
Morty: you know what? No, Rick! I'm not gonna hand you the screwdriver.
I-I'm not gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick! I'm always helping you with
this and that and the other thing.
W-w-w-w-w-what about me, Rick? W-w-w-w-why can't you just help me out once once
for once? Rick: [groans] you're growing up fast, Morty.
You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass.
[Clears throat] listen, this is called oxytocin.
I extracted it from a vole.
Do you know what a vole is, Morty? You know what a vole is? It's a it's a
rodent that mates for life, Morty.
This is the chemical released in a mammal's brain, you know, that makes it fall
in love.
All right, Morty, I just got to [burps] combine it with some of your dna.
Morty: oh, well, okay.
[Zipper opens] Rick: a hair, Morty.
I need one of your hairs.
This isn't "game of thrones.
" Morty: ow! Rick: all right, Morty.
Whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you,
forever.
Are you happy now, Morty? Morty: heck, yeah! Thank you, grandpa Rick.
Hey, there's no dangers or anything, or side effects, right? Rick: w-w-w-what
am i, a hack? Go nuts, Morty.
It's foolproof.
Eh, unless she has the flu.
Jerry: Beth, do y-you still love me? Beth: ugh, what kind of question is that?
Jerry: the "yes or no" kind? [Laughs nervously] Beth: Jerry, do you want
homeless people to have homes? Jerry: yes.
Beth: are you gonna build them? Jerry: no.
Beth: then what good was the "yes"? Jerry: wait, i-is loving me the house or
the homeless people? Beth: loving you is work, Jerry hard work, like building a
homeless shelter nobody wants to say no to doing it, but some people put the
work in.
So, what do you say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem
tedious to me? Jerry: sort of.
Beth: then I obviously sort oflove you, don't i? [Cellphone chimes] so stop
asking, and maybe I'll love you more.
Crap, they need me at the horse hospital.
Jerry: puh! This late? Beth: the racetrack had a starlight derby.
There was a seven-horse collision, and davin's there alone.
Jerry: [thinking] davin.
Davin.
Davin! Davin.
Davin! Davin! Davin! Davin! [Rapping] flu, yo you got to be aware aware of all
the flu up in the air I'm-a get me a shot and make the flu go away flu-hating
rapper just rapping away yo, yo, flu-hating rapper it's a flu-hating rapper
Morty: hey, there, Jessica.
Whoa! Oh, whoopsie! Oh, my god.
Morty.
You look really nice tonight.
Morty: wow, thanks.
I love you, Morty! I love you so much it burns! Morty: oh, man! I-i love you
too, Jessica! [Spits] is this punk bothering you, Jessica? Leave him alone,
jerk! I'm in love with him! He is more man than you will ever be! [Sneezes]
[rapping] # # this is about flu awareness got to be aware of the flu in the
air-ness yo, I'm a flu-hating rapper oh, man, Morty.
[Sighs] I'm really sorry.
Morty: oh, well, n-no problem, brad.
There's something special about you, Morty so special.
Mmm, yeah.
Morty: whoa, take it easy! Get your hands off of him! Back off! I'm trying to
be with my man! That's enough, bradley! We don't want you injuring your
ball-throwing arm.
Oh, come on, principal vagina.
I just never leave me, Morty.
Never! Morty: uh, sure.
I mean, o-of course not.
W-what do you think that was all about? Who cares? Just hold me.
Let me go! I love you, Morty! [Sneezes] let go of me! [Sneezes] Morty! Jerry:
she's gonna be alone with that guy all night.
Summer: yeah, dad, digging around the insides of horses.
It's not a very romantic setting.
Rick: well, Summer, there's always the possibility that she made the whole work
thing up.
Maybe davin's digging around in herinsides.
Summer: grandpa, so gross! You're talking about my mom.
Rick: well, she's my daughter, Summer.
I outrank you.
Or family means nothing, in which case don't play that card.
Jerry: she's not responding to my texts! Summer: careful, dad.
Jealousy turns women off.
Jerry: well, isn't that convenient? Rick: not for the men they cheat on, no.
Jerry: okay, I'm going to go out for some ice cream.
And maybe stop by the hospital to support my wife with my confidence.
[Door closes] Summer: god, grandpa, you're such a dick.
Rick: I'm sorry, Summer.
Your opinion means very little to me.
How come you're not at this stupid dance everyone loves so much? Summer: screw
that.
I don't want to get sick.
It's flu season.
Rick: it is? Summer: yeah.
Rick: uh-oh.
[Hip-hop music plays] Morty: please just let this work out.
[Moans] do it, Morty.
Do it.
Rip my clothes off and mate with me for life! [Growls] Morty: um can we maybe
go somewhere more private? Jessica, get a hold of yourself! [Grunts] you don't
deserve to carry Morty's genes.
[Rapping] I love Morty and I hope Morty loves me I'd like to wrap my arms
around him and feel him inside me Morty: oh, crap.
[Indistinct shouting] Morty! Rick: Morty, come on! We got to get you out of
here.
You're not gonna believe this because it usually never happens, but I made a
mistake.
[Both panting] come on, Morty.
We got to get out of here.
Come on.
Morty! Morty: [wails] are you okay? Morty: I'm fine! Oh, good.
If anything ever happened to you, I would kill myself.
I love you bad, mo-mo! [All panting] [indistinct shouting] Morty, the principal
and i have discussed it, a-a-and we're both insecure enough to agree to a
three-way! Rick: I didn't realize when i gave you that serum that Jessica had
the flu you know, t-t-t-t-t-t-t-that might have been valuable information for
me, Morty.
Morty: what the hell is going on, Rick? Rick: what does it look like? T-t-t-the
serum is piggybacking on the virus.
It's gone airborne, Morty.
Morty: oh, crap.
What are we gonna do, Rick? Rick: it's gonna be fine, Morty, relax.
I whipped up and antidote.
It's based on praying-mantis dna.
You know, praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles, Morty.
I mean, they they mate once, and then they, you know, decapitate the partner.
I mean, it's a whole ritual.
It's really gruesome and totally opposite.
There's no love at all.
I-i-i basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus.
It should neutralize the whole thing, Morty.
It'll all be over very shortly.
[Indistinct shouting] uh, by the way, Morty, I know you didn't ask or anything,
but I'm not interested in having sex with you.
These serums, they don't work on anybody related to you genetically.
Morty! [All groaning] Rick: okay, well, sometimes, science is more art than
science, Morty.
A lot of people don't get that.
Jerry: [gasps] [tires screech] come on.
Are you kidding me? Hello! Morty! You're not Morty! Bring us Morty! [Gun cocks]
Jerry: nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man.
I had sex with billy.
But you were already pregnant! Yeah, so what's the worst that could happen? We
interrupt "pregnant baby" with breaking news.
Summer: [groans] come on.
This just in Morty smith's whereabouts are still unknown.
Summer: what the hell? The only thing that is known is how cute he is.
I love him so much, I want to make love to him and then eat his head.
I love him more than you do, harold! You wish, you stupid bitch! Morty's mine!
Morty's mine! Meant to be together! [Speaking arabic] Morty! [Speaking arabic]
[banging on door] where is Morty? Summer: [screams] [conversing in native
language] Morty: oh, my god, Rick.
The whole world is infected! Rick: yeah, it's pretty wild how fast that spread.
I've really outdone myself.
Morty: outdone yourself?! W-w a-are are you kidding me, Rick? This is not okay!
Not only do they all want to have sex with me, but, you know, now they want to
eat me afterwards! Rick: yeah, I don't know what i was thinking.
Mantises are they opposite of voles? I mean, obviously, dna's a little more
complicated than that.
You know what, though, Morty? This right here's gonna do the tRick, baby.
It's koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, shark, golden retriever,
and just a smidge of dinosaur.
Should add up to normal humanity.
Morty: I don't that doesn't make any sense, Rick.
How does that add up to normal humanity? Morty: what, Morty, you want me to
show you my math? I'm sorry a-are you the scientist or are you the kid that
wanted to get laid? [Exhales deeply] well, I'm glad we saved all those horses,
but I'm almost sorry we're finished.
Beth: yes, it's satisfying work.
Unh-unh-unh, it's, uh it's more than the work.
I love being in that sterilized room, sealed off from the world.
It's the only time I can really think and feel.
[Slow music plays] Beth: hmm, uh, what are you doing? I'm playing african dream
pop.
What do youdo after a long night? [Click] Beth: oh, ha, um, hey, I b I'd better
get going.
Um, Jerry's been texting some pretty high-maintenance stuff.
Beth Beth: what is it, davin? Just once, I'd like to know [sneezes] w-w-what it
was like to give your son a bath.
Beth: what?! What does Morty's skin smell like? How soft [grunts] how soft are
his privates? Beth: let go of me, davin! [Glass shatters] [roars] take me to
Morty.
Jerry: [grunts] you're not Morty.
Jerry: no.
I'm mr.
Crowbar, and this is my friend, who is also a crowbar.
That's stupid.
Jerry: [grunting] yeah? Well, look where being smart got you.
Beth: Jerry! Thank god! Jerry: god? God's turning people into insect monsters,
Beth.
I'm the one beating them to death.
Thank me.
Beth: thank you, Jerry.
Thank you.
Rick: take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in, because, you know,
once I pull this lever, it's all back to normal.
Morty: just do it already.
Rick: well, technically, Morty, there's no rush.
I mean, you know, o-once it's fixed, it's done.
It's fixed.
You know, we could we could just enjoy it for a little bit.
I mean, l-l-l-look at how crazy it is.
I mean, Morty, w-w-when's the next time you're gonna see something like this? I
mean, soak it in, you know? It's it's pretty neat.
It's pretty interesting.
Morty: that's it, Rick! I'm pulling the lever.
[Grunts] Rick: w-what do we have here, Morty? Looks like I was right and you
were wrong, huh? I-i-i-i-i-i-i bet you feel pretty stupid right about now, huh?
I-i-i bet you feel like the world's smallest man that you were doubting me
about this whole thing, Morty.
Morty: oh, Rick, something's not right.
Rick: [sighs] yeah, you.
You're not right ever.
Morty: no, no! Look, you idiot! [All screaming] [all speaking native language]
[all groaning] [all ululating] Rick: bet you're loving this, Morty.
This must be the best day of your life.
You get to be the mayor of i told you town.
[Slurps] you're welcome.
[Slurps] Jerry: hold on.
Beth: [whimpers] [engine revs, tires squeal] [gun cocks] Jerry: I wish that
shotgun was my penis.
Beth: if it were, you could call me ernest hemingway.
Jerry: I don't get it, and i don't need to.
[Both moaning] Summer: mom! Dad! Both: Summer! Beth: [sighs] Jerry: where's
Morty? Summer: I don't know.
Do you think grandpa Rick had something to do with this? Jerry: it's not fair
to assume that, Summer.
Beth: oh, not fair? Give me a break.
He is a selfish, irresponsible ass, and he left my mother.
A real man stands by his woman.
[Both moaning] Summer: tchoo.
Tchoo-tchoo-tchoo.
Tchoo-tchoo.
Rick: boy, Morty, I really cronenberged the world up, didn't i? We got a whole
planet of cronenbergs walking around down there, Morty.
A-at least they're not in love with you anymore, though.
That's a huge step in the right direction.
Morty: oh, my god! It's a living nightmare! How could you be so irresponsible,
Rick? Rick: me irresponsible?! You all I wanted you to do was hand me a
screwdriver, Morty! You're the one who wanted to be wanted me to buckle down
and make you up a roofie-juice serum so you could roofie that poor girl at your
school.
I mean, g w-w-w-w-w w are you kidding me, Morty? You're gonna try to take the
high road on this one? Y-y-y-y-you're a little creep, Morty.
Y-you're a you're you're you're just a little creepy creep person.
Morty: all right, fine.
I should have just listened to you when you refused to make the serum.
I'm willing to accept my part of the blame for this, Rick.
But I'll tell you something you know what? You got to accept your part of the
blame! I'm not the one who fouled up the serum! I'm not the one who who who who
haphazardly, you know, mixed a bunch of nonsense together and created a bunch
of cronenbergs! You got to fix this, Rick! Morty: all right, all right, Morty.
You know, w-w-w-we are in a pretty deep hole, here, but I do have one emergency
solution that i can use that'll kind of put everything back to normal,
relatively speaking.
Here, Morty, put this on while i do a little bit of scouting.
[Birds chirping] Morty: wow, Rick, I got to say you really pulled a rabbit out
of your hat this time.
I mean, i-i really thought that the whole place was gonna be messed up for
good, but here, you did it y-y-you you you figured out that crazy solution,
like you always do.
Whoo! That's some great luck.
Rick: come on, Morty.
Luck had nothing to do with it.
I'm great.
That's the real reason.
Now, Morty, what do you say, buddy? Will you hand me a screwdriver so I can
finish my ionic dis defibulizer? Morty: sure thing, Rick.
Here's a screwdriver.
Rick: all right, Morty.
Thank you very much.
We got one screw turn and two screw turns and all right, Morty, here we are.
Morty: oh, my god, Rick! Is that us?! W-w-w-we're dead! What is going on, Rick?
I'm freaking out! Rick: calm down, Morty! Look at me! Calm down, Morty! Morty:
no, I can't deal with this! Rick: calm yourself, Morty.
Morty: I can't deal with this, Rick! Rick: calm down, Morty.
Morty: this can't be real! Rick: you got to calm down, Morty.
Morty: w-w-w-w-we're ripped apart! Rick: shut up and listen to me! It's fine.
Everything is fine.
There's an infinite number of realities, Morty, and in a few dozen of those, I
got lucky and turned everything back to normal.
I just had to find one of those realities in which we also happen to both die
around this time.
Now we can just slip into the place of our dead selves in this reality and
everything will be fine.
We're not skipping a beat, Morty.
Now, help me with these bodies.
Morty: this is insane.
Rick: look, Morty, I'll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay? I mean,
t-t-t-that seems fair to me I mean, that seems like a fair way to divvy it up.
Morty: Rick, what about the reality we left behind? Rick: what about the
reality where hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is don't think about it.
It's not like we can do this every week, anyways.
We get three or four more of these, tops.
Now, pick up your dead self and come on.
Haste makes waste.
I-i-i don't suppose you've considered this detail, but obviously, if I hadn't
screwed up as much as I did, we'd be these guys right now, so, again, you're
welcome.
look on down from the bridge there's still fountains down there look on down
from the bridge it's still raining up here everybody seems so far away from me
everybody just wants to be free look away from the sky it's no different when
you're leaving home I can't be the same thing to you now I'm just gone just
gone how could I say goodbye? how could I say goodbye? Summer: you know, the
thing about a shark he's got lifeless eyes black eyes, like a doll's eyes.
When he comes at ya, he doesn't seem to be living until he bites ya, and then
the the blood, and the red, and the water Jerry: [sighs] you ever wonder what
happened to Rick and Morty? Beth: sometimes.
But, I'm ashamed to admit, now that they're gone, I'm finally happy.
Rick: here we are, cronenberg Morty a reality where everyone in the world got
genetically cronenberged.
We'll fit right in, cronenberg Morty.
It'll be like we never even left cronenberg world.
Morty: yeah, cronenberg Rick, but, you know, I'm gonna miss cronenberg world,
because everyone was cronenberged all along like us from the beginning, you
know? I mean, i-i wish we hadn't genetically ruined cronenberg world beyond
repair like we did, you know, and turned everyone into regular, normal people
just walking around.
Rick: don't you worry about that sort of thing, cronenberg Morty.
Let's go make ourselves at home, huh?
